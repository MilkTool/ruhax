Pur ruby code compiled into haxe code

##Â Example

You can play examples from "examples" folder e.g :
```bin/console build --src examples/hello_world.rb```

And... magic ! You should see something like that
```haxe
class Main{
public static function main() {
trace("Hello World");
}

}
```

Add ```--debug``` flag to get AST of the file

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
